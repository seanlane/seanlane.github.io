After 7 years in scouting, I achieved the rank of Eagle Scout. My project consisted of removing an existing flagpole that was too small and installing a custom made one that was twice as large. The flagpole sits adjacent to a memorial to fallen aerial firefighters outside of the Porterville Air Attack Base in  Porterville, California.

An album of the project and a small article from the local newspaper about the project may be viewed at the following links:
