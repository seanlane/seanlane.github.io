I spent two years in South America where I served as a Missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Asunci칩n, Paraguay

My missionary service in Paraguay has been one of the defining experiences in my life. I'm very grateful for the opportunity to have met some amazing people and share a message that means the world to me. Below are some albums from different areas where I resided over the course of my two year mission.
