# Theorem 5.8

> Our first theorem requires no proof.

_For every function_ $f$, 

$$
  DTIME(f) \subseteq DSPACE(f)
$$
_and_
$$
  NTIME(f) \subseteq NSPACE(f)

# Lemma 5.1

* Let $M$ be a one-tape $S(n)$ space-bounded Turing machine
  * $S(n) \geq log(n)$

* Define the _length_ ($l$?) of a configuration $I$ of $M$ to be the length of the work tape of $M$ in configuration $I$.
  * $log(n) \leq l \leq S(n)$

* There exists a constant $k$ such that for each $n$ and each $l$ the number of different configurations of $M$ having length $l$ on any input of length $n$ is at most $k^l$. 

* In particular, the number of different configurations of $M$ on any input of length $n$ is at most $k^{S(n)}$.

---

# Lemma 5.1, Proof

Assume that $M$ has $s$ states and $t$ tape symbols. A configuration $I$ of $M$ of length $l$ consists of:

1. Input head position (at most $n$ + 1)
2. The tape head position (at most $l$)
3. The current state (at most $s$)
4. The tape contents (at most $t^l$)

Hence $M$ has at most $(n + 1)slt^l$ different configurations. We claim that there exists a constant $k$ such that for all $n \geq 1$ and $l: log(n) \leq l \leq S(n)$,

$$
  k^l \geq (n + 1)slt^l
$$

---

# Lemma 5.1, Proof

Key sequence of inequalities:

$$
\begin{align}
  n^cd^l &= 2^{c \cdot log(n)}d^l \\\
         &= 2^{c \cdot log(n)}2^{d\_{1}l} \text{, for some } d\_1 \\\
         &= 2^{c \cdot log(n) + d_1l} \\\
         &\leq 2^{cl + d_1l} \text{, since } log(n) \leq l \\\
         &= k^l \text{, for some } k.
\end{align} 
$$

This Lemma provides the foundation of the proof for the following theorem. 

---

# Theorem 5.9

If $L$ is accepted by and $S(n)$ space-bounded Turing machine with

$$S(n) \geq log(n)$$

then $L$ is accepted by an $S(n)$ space-bounded Turing machine that halts on every input. 

---

# Theorem 5.9, Proof

* Let $M$ be a one-tape $S(n)$ space-bounded Turing machine that accepts $L$
  * Space-bounded TM $\implies$ off-line TM

* Let $k$ be the constant guaranteed by Lemma 5.1
* Design a TM $N$ to simulate $M$:
  * Simulate $M$ on one track
  * Use the other track to count in base $k$
  * Guarantees that we only use $S(n)$ space to count to $k^{S(n)}$
  * Shut off after $k^{S(n)}$ moves

* For each length $l: log(n) \leq l \leq S(n)$, $N$ uses no more than $l$ space to count to $k^l$

---

# Theorem 5.9, Proof

* Let $N$ initially assign $log(n)$ space to the counting tape

* When $M$ scans a new cell, increase the counter length by 1
  * When we get an integer overflow in our counter, give it another bit 

* Now suppose that $M$ repeats one of this finite configurations.
  * This must occur when $M$ uses some $l$ number of cells, with $l \leq S(n)$

* We can now detect when looping occurs because eventually the counter will need more than $k^{S(n)}$ cells to count the number of moves of $M$
  * This stems from Lemma 5.1
  * Because $M$ is $S(n)$ space-bounded, the largest the counter should get to is $S(n)$
  * Any acceptable input would have already accepted, so we can now safely reject
  * $L(N) = L(M)$

---

# Corollary 5.6

$$
  DSPACE(S(n)) \subseteq \bigcup \\{ DTIME(c^{S(n)}) | c \geq 1 \\},
$$
for $S(n) \geq log(n)$.

* An extension of Theorem 5.9
* If we can cap the number of possible configurations, then that cap can then be used to bound the language in time

---

# Theorem 5.10

$$
  NTIME(T(n)) \subseteq DSPACE(T(n)).
$$

* Recall the Breadth-First Search Method to prove Theorem 2.3 (pg. 33)
  * Every nondeterministic Turing machine has an equivalent deterministic Turing machine

* This theorem claims that the deterministic Turing machine used in proving Theorem 2.3 is T(n) space-bounded

---

# Theorem 5.10, Proof

* Let $L$ be accepted by a (nondeterministic) $k$-tape TM $N$ in time $T(n)$.

* Assign addresses to each node of $N$'s computational tree

* Each computation path of $N$ on input of length $n$ is bounded by $T(n)$

  * All paths must terminate within $T(n)$ moves
  
  * Every address has a length $\leq T(n)$ 

???

* Pretty sure $N$ is supposed to be nondeterministic
* Important difference between this proof and the one Stanley sent:
  * In this proof $N$ accepts $L$.
  * In Stanley's paper: $N$ decides $L$.
* Author should really pick more variable names

---

# Theorem 5.10, Proof

* Let $M$ be a $k+2$-tape off-line TM
  * Simulate $N$ on tapes $1 \dots k$
  * Use tape $k + 1$ to keep track of where we are in the computational tree of $N$
  * Use tape $k + 2$ to keep track of whether the BFS should continue down another level

* Since $N$ is time-bound by $T(n)$, each tape $1 \dots k$ can use no more than $T(n)$ number of cells
  * By the given process of $M$, tape $k + 1$ also uses at most T(n) cells
    * Tape $k + 2$ only uses one cell, and $1 \leq T(n)$

* Then $L \in DSPACE(O(S(n))) \implies L \in DSPACE(S(n))$ by Corollary 5.1

---

# Corollary 5.7

$$
  NP \subseteq PSPACE
$$

* Let $b$ be equal to the maximum number of choices in the transition function of $N$ from the previous proof

* Then there are at most $b^{T(n)}$ unique computation paths in the computation tree of $N$

* Each path takes at most $T(n)$ steps

* Then imagine doing a DFS of the computational tree of $N$
  * Each branch will use at most $T(n)$ cells

---

# Theorem 5.11

$$
  NTIME(T(n)) \subseteq \bigcup \\{DTIME(c^{T(n)}) | c \geq 1\\}
$$

* Let $L$ be accepted by $M$ in time $T(n)$

* Let $M$ be a nondeterministic TM with $s$ states and $t$ symbols

* Then a configuration of $M$ consists of:
  1. The current state (at most $s$)
  2. The position of each tape head (at most $(T(n) + 1)^k$)
  3. The tape contents (at most $t^{kT(n)}$)

* Then there are at most $s(T(n) + 1)^{k}t^{kT(n)}$ unique configurations for $M$

* We can show that there exists a constant $d$ such that

$$
  s(T(n) + 1)^{k}t^{kT(n)} \leq d^{T(n)}
$$

for all $n > 0$.

---

# Theorem 5.11, Proof

* Let $I_0$ indicate the initial configuration of $M$
* Let $I'$ indicate the configurations reachable from a given configuration $I$
* Design a TM $N$ to list all possible configurations of $M$ that are reachable from $I_0$ via the following process:

```java
  place I_0 on the list
  for each configuration I on the list do:
    place all configurations I' on the list
    that M can reach in one move
    and that are not already on the list
  until for each I on the list, no such I' exists
```

* A RAM can do this in time $O(($length of list$)^2)$
* Then we can design $N$ to compute the above in time $($length of list$)^c$ for some constant $c$
* Length of list $\leq d^{T(n)} \cdot $ (length of configuration)
  * Length of configuration is bounded by some polynomial $T(n)$

$$
  O(1)^{T(n)}T(n)^O(1) = O(1)T(n)
$$

# Theorem 5.12

Let $S(n) \geq log(n)$. 
  
Let $M$ be a nondeterministic off-line Turing machine such that for every word $x \in L(M)$ there is an accepting computation of $M$ on $x$ that scans at most $S(n)$ cells on any work tape. 
  
Then there is a deterministic on-line Turing machine $N$ such that $L(N) = L(M)$ and there is a constant $c$ such that for every $x \in L(N)$, $N$ on input $x$ makes at most $c^{S(n)}$ moves.

This proof works similarly to the proof for Theorem 5.11, except we can't guarantee that we can calculate $S(n)$. So we simply guess, letting $l = 1$ and attempting every path that is bounded by $l$. If all $l$-bounded paths fail to accept, increment $l$ by one and repeat

---

# Theorem 5.12, Proof

* Note: $\vdash^{*}_{M}$ is the transitive closure of $M$'s next move relation
  * For configurations $A, B$ : $A \vdash^{*}\_{M} B \iff A = B$ or there exists a sequence of configurations $A\_1,\dots,A\_k$ such that

  $$
    A = A\_1 \vdash\_M A\_2 \vdash\_M \dots \vdash\_M A\_k = B
  $$   

* Keeping track of $l$ on one of it's work tapes, $N$ finds all configurations  
  $I: I\_0 \vdash^*_M I$ which are also $l$-bounded. If none accept, increment $l$ by one.

* The process could run indefinitely; if $M$ accepts $x$, then $N$ will find an accepting $I$ for some $l \leq S(n)$

---

# Theorem 5.12, Proof

* Let $V_{x,l}$ indicate the set of all configs. of $M$ on input $x$ that are $l$-bounded

* Order the configs. within each set, such that $0$ indicates the initial configuration

* Let $A\_{x,l}$ be the Boolean matrix of size $||V\_{x,l}|| \times ||V_{x,l}||$

  * Each cell is defined by the next move relation $\vdash\_M$ of $M$ constrained to the configurations in $V\_{x,l}$:

  $$
    \forall i, j: 1 \leq i, j \leq ||V\_{x,l}||, A\_{x,l}(i,j) = 1 \iff I\_i \vdash\_M I\_j
  $$

* Transitive closure of an $n \times n$ matrix is $O(n^3)$ for a RAM

* Then $N$ can compute $A^{*}\_{x,l}$ within $||V\_{x,l}||^{O(1)}$ moves

---

# Theorem 5.12, Proof

* $M$ accepts $x \iff \exists l \leq S(n)$ and $j \leq ||V\_{x,l}||: I\_j$ is an accepting configuration and $A^{*}\_{x,l}(0,j) = 1$

* In other words, if $M$ accepts $x$ then $N$ accepts $x$ within

$$
  \sum\_{l=1}^{S(n)} ||V\_{x,l}||^{O(1)}
$$

* Then we can find a constant $c: \forall l, ||V\_{x,l}|| \leq c^{S(n)}$. Thus:

$$
  \sum\_{l=1}^{S(n)} ||V\_{x,l}||^{O(1)} = O(1)^{S(n)}
$$

# Theorem 5.13 - Savitch's Theorem

If $S$ is fully space-constructible and $S(n) \geq log(n)$, then

$$
  NSPACE(S(n)) \subseteq DSPACE(S^2(n)).
$$

We could try a Depth First Search approach, like with Corollary 5.7, but this would leave us with an exponential upper bound rather than a polynomial bound.

Recall: A function $S(n)$ is fully space-constructible if there exists an $S(n)$ space-bounded Turing machine such that for every input of length $n$, $M$ uses exactly $S(n)$ cells.

Corollaries 5.9 & 5.10 stem from Savitch's Theorem

---

# Theorem 5.13, Proof

* Let $S$ be a fully space-constructible function such that $log(n) \leq S(n)$

* Let $L = L(M)$ where $M$ is an $S(n)$ space-bounded one-tape nondeterministic Turing machine
  * $s$ states
  * $t$ tape symbols

* Lemma 5.1 (pg. 99): There exists a constant $c: c^{S(n)} \geq$ the number of configurations for an input of length $n$

* If $M$ accepts $w$, then a shortest accepting computation will not repeat any configuration
  * $|w| = n$

* Then there is an accepting configuration with a length $\leq c^{S(n)}$

---

# Theorem 5.13, Proof

* Let $m = \lceil{log(c)}\rceil$

* The length of $c^{S(n)}$ written in binary notation is at most:
$$
  \lceil{log(c)^{S(n)}}\rceil \leq S(n) \lceil{log(c)}\rceil = mS(n)
$$

* Note that $2^{mS(n)} \geq c^{S(n)}$

* Then if $M$ accepts $w$, then there exists a sequence of at most $2^{mS(n)}$ moves from $I\_0$ to an accepting configuration $I\_a$
  * Both of these configurations, and all intermediate configurations, have a length $\leq S(n)$

---

# Theorem 5.13, Proof

Define a computable function TEST:

$$
  \text{TEST}(I\_1, I\_2, i): \text{ Boolean}.
$$

* TEST returns true _iff_ there exists a sequence of at most $2^i$ moves from $I\_1$ to $I\_2$ with all intermediate moves having a length no longer than $S(n)$

* We then used this function to determine if $w \in L$ through the procedure in Fig. 4 (pg. 105)

* Now that the procedure has been detailed, it remains to be shown that it can be implemented by an $S^2(n)$ space-bounded deterministic Turing machine.

---

# Theorem 5.13, Proof

* Find space requirements for active variables in TEST:
  * Each configuration $I\_1, I\_2, I'$ need $S(n)$ or less space
    * Same for the storage tape and head positions
  * $log(n) \leq S(n)$, so the input head position can be written in $S(n)$ space or less
  * $i \leq mS(n)$, so $i$ can also be written in $O(S(n))$ space

* Each recursive call of TEST requires saving the states of global and local variables when called
* Though called twice per level, the second is only called after the first (and only when the first result is positive)
* Each level decrements $i$ by one, thus there are at most $mS(n)$ recursive levels of TEST called
* If there are at most $mS(n)$ stack layers, with each layer requiring $O(S(n))$ space, then TEST requires $O(S^2(n))$ space
* By Corollary 5.1, $O(S^2(n))$ space can be compressed to $S^2(n)$ space, which concludes the proof

Homework 5.8: Prove Corollary 5.8. 

(Observe, for each constant $c$, that $c^{S(n)}$ is fully time-constructible when $S$ is. Also, observe that $n \in o(c^{S(n)})$, so the construction in Section 5.2.1 can be made to work (see pg. 91).)
