    <h2>Aftermath</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        At 32 years old, Shannon garnered interest from around the world with his work
        <ul>
          <li>
            Not all was positive though
            <ul>
              <li>Mathematician Joseph Doob argued that the proofs were not rigorous enough</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Paper was successful due to the pragmatic focus that Shannon had with a background in both mathematics and electrical engineering</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Aftermath</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ultimately, the entirety of <em>A Mathematical Theory of Communication</em> was proven to be correct</li>
      <li>
        After meeting in 1948, Shannon marries Mary Elizabeth “Betty” Moore in March of 1949
        <ul>
          <li>Betty was a mathematician in her own right at Bell Labs, and would often help Shannon with his idea</li>
          <li>Also, Shannon hated to write and Betty would help dictate in addition to helping Shannon formulate his thoughts</li>

    <h2>Back to MIT</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>After 15 years with Bell Labs, Shannon leaves in 1956</li>
      <li>Returns to MIT in order to maintain the intellectual freedom to pursue his interests</li>
      <li>He began teaching advanced courses in information theory, and MIT became a leading institution in the field</li>
      <li>His personality lead him to avoid much teaching or advising, but he continued pursuing problems</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Back to MIT</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Contributed to work in Artificial Intelligence
        <ul>
