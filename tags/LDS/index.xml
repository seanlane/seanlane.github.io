      <description>This post is not about technology, computer science, or programming. Instead it&amp;rsquo;s a call back to my time as an LDS missionary in Paraguay. During my time there, I came across a talk given by an Elder Lawrence Corbridge that I really enjoyed. Some friends of mine were asking about it, and I wanted to make a copy in English and Spanish easily accessible. Please find the links to copies below.</description>

      <description>I spent two years in South America where I served as a Missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Asunción, Paraguay&#xA;My missionary service in Paraguay has been one of the defining experiences in my life. I&amp;rsquo;m very grateful for the opportunity to have met some amazing people and share a message that means the world to me. Below are some albums from different areas where I resided over the course of my two year mission.</description>
