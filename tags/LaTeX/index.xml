      <description>This is another living post that serves more for my personal benefit than anything else. By living, I mean that I will continue to update it over time as I find things I want to keep easily accessible. This post is a place to paste snippets and boiler plate of Markdown/Pandoc/LaTeX material that I find useful but often forget. There&amp;rsquo;s probably nothing very genius or awe-inspiring here, but hopefully I won&amp;rsquo;t have to grep through by bash history as often, trying to remember what I did that one time to do that one thing.</description>

      <description>Another quick post, but something that I hope might be useful to others. Within the past couple weeks, my grandmother of 83 years passed away and my family held a memorial service in her honor. I was asked if I could help out in creating a program booklet or pamphlet that could be given out to the attendees, something that would describe the service itself as well as share a piece of my grandmother&amp;rsquo;s life with them as we gathered to remember her.</description>
