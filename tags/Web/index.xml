      <description>Note: As of February 2018, the repo for this website is public, so I moved the comments to the same repo instead of using a separate project for them.&#xA;When I created a blog to have a place to write and document things, as well as complete a class requirement for CS 404, there were properties that I wanted it to have. I wanted it to be simple, to be hosted on a reputable platform, to be under my control, and to perform well.</description>
